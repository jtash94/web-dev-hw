<br>
<p> 1. Padding is the set space between the text/image in a div box and the outer edge. <br> A margin is the space between div boxes themselves. <br> Borders form an outline around the entire element, and can be customized. </p>

<p> 2. The most difficult part of this assignment was getting all the elements in the right place on the page. <br> It's difficult to visualize pixel size to see where everything should go when using relative or absolute properties, and <br> when it takes the live site a few minutes to load, I tend to panic and assume I did something wrong and then I overdo customizations and ruin everything. </p>

<p> 3. For this assignment, I downloaded all the materials, studied the ad and started by putting all the elements into my index. I didn't start my stylesheet until the index was completely finished, and then I started ordering things left to right as per the example.<br> After everything was in place after lots and trial and error, I added fonts/customizations, padding, borders, etc, and then checked the assignment page to make sure I included everything. </p>
