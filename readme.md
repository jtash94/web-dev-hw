<h1>Readme.md for Assignment 3</h1>
<ol>
<li>There should only be one head element per file, but there may be multiple body tags in the event of multiple headlines and subsections within a page. Body tags are used to separate content between subheadings, while head is merely for the title of each page.</li>
<li>Semantic markup is when tags are used stylistically to convey human-specific meaning, and structural markup refers to the correct ordering and set-up of an .html for the sake of the computer's accurate reading of the document. </li>
<li>My work cycle was to begin reading materials, then I did the index with bare-bones elements only. After, I put in the formatting elements, going step-by-step as outlined on the assignment page. Then I did the following two pages in the same fashion, pushing to github periodically, followed by the readme.</li>
