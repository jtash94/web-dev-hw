<h1><b>Directions</b>(in order)</font></h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Cover beets with 2 inches water in a pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer until very tender when pierced with the tip of a sharp paring knife,<br/> about 30 minutes. Drain. Puree beets in a food processor until smooth.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and 3/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl.<br/> Whisk in eggs, water, oil, vanilla, and 1 1/4 cups beet puree (reserve remaining puree for another use).</li>
        <li>Coat a 9-inch round cake pan (3 inches deep) with cooking spray. Line bottom with parchment, and coat with spray. Pour batter into pan. Bake until a <br/> toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Let cool in pan on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Turn out cake from pan, and discard<br/> parchment. Let cool completely, right side up.</li>
        <li>Trim top of cake using a serrated knife to create a level surface. Transfer cake, cut side down, to a platter. Pour chocolate glaze over the top, and let <br/> set, about 30 minutes. Garnish with beet chips.</li>
