<br>
<p>1. I chose Playfair Display and Noto Serif, both with serifs. I did so <br>
because I thought they both looked serious without looking like they wanted <br>
to look too serious. I went with a grayish-blue for a nautical theme, and used <br>
red for accents (link and first line). <br> </p>
<p>2. A system font is the default one used by an OS for all text, while a <br>
web font is used on websites with a stylesheet. A web-safe font is one that <br>
is likely to appear normally and load quickly across all OS and browsers. <br>
Fallback fonts are used in the event that a browser can't access the original <br>
font, or does something weird to it, so it defaults to the second in the stack. </p>
I started by looking at my own past assignments to recall some formatting things, <br> and then I started reading/watching all materials. Then I picked my text <br>
excerpt, inputted it into my index.html, did the stylesheet, and then the font <br> sheet. I had a hard time understanding @fontface, but I got it after some <br>
trial and error.
